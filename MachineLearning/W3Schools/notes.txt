Machine Learning (ML) 
Make the PC learn from studying data and statistics.
Step into AI.
ML is a program that analyses data and learns to predict the outcome.

Data Set
    Any collection of data.
        Can be anything from an array to a complete database.
    Ex. of an array:
        [99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86]
        Here we can guess that the average value is probably around 80 or 90; we are also able to determine the highest and lowest value.
    Ex. of a database:
        Carname     Color   Age     Speed   AutoPass
        BMW         red     5       99      Y
        Volvo       black   7       86      Y
        VW          gray    8       87      N
        VW          white   7       88      Y
        Ford        white   2       111     Y
        VW          gray    17      86      N
        Tesla       red     2       103     Y
        Toyota      white   4       87      N

        Here we can see that the most popular color is white, and the oldest car is 17 years, but what if we could predict if a car had an AutoPass, just by looking at the other values?
            ML does that, it analyses data and predicts the outcome. 

Data Types
    To analyse data we have to know what type of data we are dealing with.
    Data is split into 3 main categories:
        Numerical:
            Numbers;
            2 numerical categories:
                Discrete Data - numbers that are limited to integers (Ex.: number of cars passing by);
                Continuous Data - numbers that are of infinite value (Ex.: price of an item, height of a person, etc.).
        Categorical:
            Values that cannot be measured up against each other (Ex.: a color value, or any yes/no values).
        Ordinal:
            Like categorical data, but can be measured up against each other (Ex.: school grades where A is better than B and so on).
    
    Knowing the data type of your data source, you will be able to know what technique to use when analyzing them.

Mean, Median and Mode
    Mean - The average value;
    Median - The mid point value;
    Mode - The most common value.
